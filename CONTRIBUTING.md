# Contributing to FamilyEye 🤝

Glad you want to help improve FamilyEye! Every bug fix or idea counts.

## How to Contribute (Simple & Human)

1.  **Fork it** - Make a copy of the project to your own account.
2.  **Fix/Edit it** - Make changes in your `feature` branch.
3.  **Send a PR (Pull Request)** - Once you're done, send it back.

### Technical Minimum

- Keep your code clean so we can understand it.

## ⚖️ Legal Agreement (Required Minimum)

To keep the project sustainable, we need clear rights:

**By submitting a contribution (Pull Request), you confirm that:**
1.  You are the author of the code.
2.  You grant the project maintainer (**Róbert Pešout (BertSoftware) - robert.pesout@gmail.com**) the unlimited, perpetual right to use, modify, and incorporate this code into future versions of the project, **even under other (including commercial) licenses**.

*Why?* Because we want the option to develop the project in any direction in the future without having to chase down hundreds of contributors for permission. You remain the author, but you give us a free hand with your contribution.

## Code of Conduct
